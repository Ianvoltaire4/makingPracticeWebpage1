    <h1>Hello I'm Ian.</h1>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank"href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,will%20not%20be%20a%20hyperlink."><button>Click me!</button></a>

        <a target="_blank"href="https://www.youtube.com">https://www.youtube.com</a>

    <div>
        <p>The href specifies the url of the page the link goes to. If the href isn't present the (a) tag will not be a hyperlink.</p>
        <p>The reason the button works is because of the href attribute. Without it this button wouldn't take me anywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>The title you see is apart of the (head) tag. The (head) tag is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the (hmtl) tag and the (body) tag. If you were wondering Metadata is data about the (html) document and not displayed, the (title),(style),(base),(link), (meta), and (script) all go inside the head tag.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p style="color: red;">My attribute is color, the color property specifies the color of the text. In css, a color can be specified by using a predifined color name: Like orange, tomato, violet, dodgerblue. You can also set border colors to help you visualize how spaced  or close you're text, pictures, and any other elements are on the page. You can also you RGB values if you want a specific color, for example I used RBG values for the header, and RGBA if you wanted your text to be transparent.</p>

        <p>As you can see in the line above it is red as all the other are black, and if I link my index.css every line except the one above, and my header will be blue.</p>

        <p>Color is very important for styling a webpage and making certain words stand out.</p>

        <p>Use a background-color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.</p>

    <div>
        <form>
            <label for="fname">First name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">
        </form>
        <p>That was for practice please ignore it.</p>
